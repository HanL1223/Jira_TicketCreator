* Everything will be automated (CI/CD) – means alignment to security and quick turnaround for future data sharing requests from any team

 

*Cost:*

* For Rachel’s warehouse, start with extra small, apply a cap amount of our choosing
* If above doesn’t suffice then we would dial up accordingly

 

*Timelines:*

* Est delivery date is +*26*++^*th*^+ +*Feb*+ (we aim to finish by +*18*++^*th*^+ +*Feb*++)+

The existing Appriss Datashare ELT query requires refinement to improve accuracy, maintainability, and alignment with the current data product standards. This work ensures the ELT logic is consistent with the latest Appriss data-share requirements, resolves gaps identified during QA, and prepares the pipeline for downstream reporting dependencies.

h2. Steps

# Review the current Appriss Datashare ELT SQL and document all existing joins, filters, transformations, and business rules.
# Identify inconsistencies, redundant logic, missing filters, or misaligned business definitions based on updated Appriss documentation and stakeholder feedback.
# Update and refine the SQL ELT logic to reflect the correct business rules, ensuring alignment with Bronze → Silver conventions and naming standards.
# Validate refined output against expected Appriss samples (e.g., benchmark extracts, QA logs, historical outputs).
# Optimise query performance where appropriate (index use, partition pruning, CTE structure, join ordering).
# Peer review with Data Engineering and validate with Appriss SME before promoting the updated query.
# Update documentation, lineage, and add comments within the SQL code for ongoing maintainability.

h2. Deliverables

* Refined and validated Appriss Datashare ELT SQL query.
* Comparison document outlining logic changes vs previous version.
* Updated data lineage / documentation in Confluence & Alation.
* Peer-review sign-off and test results.

h3. *Context*

Users are intermittently unable to see application content in Cognos. IBM’s initial investigation indicates a correlation with JVM memory pressure; JVM size has been increased as recommended.
Further internal analysis shows the issue occurs mainly on Mondays and Tuesdays and coincides with heavy execution of the _Buyer Category Performance Drill-Through Report_, which queries large-volume data across multiple tables.
This report appears to be a significant contributor to JVM load and may be impacting overall Cognos stability.

As discussed with Bhavya, removed WarehouseLocation attribute from model (this cannot be done where the source is from AX - WarehouseLocation will sit on the FactWarehouseInventoryLocation-Intra/History models instead).

Renamed StockCostPrice to AverageRealCost.
Added AverageNetworkCost and AverageStoreCost (based on advice from Bhavya).
Removed StockAmount (this is removed from the platinum model, but will be added into the gold layer)."

* ALTIDA has its own Git repo containing all ALTIDA code, config, IaC and pipeline definitions.
* No ALTIDA code/config/IaC lives in any core platform or shared infrastructure repo. Other repos can reference ALTIDA only via documented loosely coupled integration points (eg. queues, file locations, APIs).
* Disabling ALTIDA pipelines and archiving the ALTIDA repo does not require code changes in other repos beyond removing those integration references.

*IaC and no Click-Ops:*

* All Snowflake and cloud resources required by ALTIDA are defined and managed only via IaC in ALTIDA repo (no portal or Snowflake UI changes).
* A new environment (eg. DEV/SIT/UAT) can be provisioned from empty to full working ALTIDA by running the documented CI/CD pipeline, with no manual steps.

*CI/CD Configuration:*

* ALTIDA has dedicated CI/CD pipelines in its repo for build, test/validation and deploy to each environment.
* Environment differences are handled via parameters and secrets (eg. Key Vault) not by branching code or hand-editing config in the UI.

*Security & Access:*

* ALTIDA uses its own service accounts and roles (Snowflake, cloud) defined in IaC with least privilege, limited to the layers/resources it needs (Landing/Bronze) and not to curated/core platform components
* No shared “god” roles or service accounts exists between ALTIDA and other platform components. Secrets are stored only in approved secret stores, not in code or pipeline definitions.

*Replaceability/Decommissioning:*

* The ALTIDA repo includes a short, tested decommission procedure describing how to disable ALTIDA, remove its resources and revoke its identities without impacting the rest of the platform.
* There are no hard dependencies on ALTIDA internals in other repos (no imports of ALTIDA libraries or assumptions about ALTIDA-specific structures). Integration contracts are documented so a future replacement data ingestion solution can plug into the same interfaces.","Hi @user please add the Acceptance Criteria when you are ready.

Investigate and resolve the rounding discrepancy in *Invoice ID: 35358912688554000*, where the total amount in the header ($100.00) does not align with the sum of the line items (approximately $19.00). The tender record also reflects $100.00, suggesting a data integrity or rounding issue between header, line item, and tender tables.

*Steps*

# Confirm with stakeholders whether the total amount should always equal the sum of all line items (excluding rounding tolerances) in the secure database schema.
# Data Engineering team to validate if the discrepancy originates from:
#* Source system calculation or rounding logic, or
#* ETL transformation or aggregation logic in the current data pipeline.
# Identify all affected invoices exhibiting similar discrepancies.","*Acceptance Criteria*

* *Root Cause Identified:* Source of the discrepancy (source system vs ETL logic) is clearly documented.
* *Fix Implemented:* Data logic corrected and validated so that header totals reconcile with summed line items (within accepted rounding limits).
* *Validation Passed:* QA confirms that post-fix, total header and item-level values are consistent across test invoices.","AC Nov 4: CW to investigate

AC Nov 18: Total value received by staff from Customer : $100

Mode of Payment: Cash

Line Item Total: $15.98

Rounding: $.02

Total Line Item: $16

Change given to Customer: $84

Invoice Header Amount value and Invoice Line item amount sum may differ whenever there is a cash payment involved. In this invoice:35358912688554000 if someone pays cash as payment and gives $100 to the cashier for products worth $16. Then the Total Amount from the product line item would be $16, and Header Invoice would be $100. It does not take the change returned ($84 ) into account."

* We need a simple, durable Git repo naming standard for the Enterprise Data Platform (EDP) that works across clouds/regions without future renames. Use lowercase *kebab-case* and avoid embedding env/region/provider in names.

h3. Objective

* Adopt a task-oriented pattern and pair it with CI/CD parameters for multi-cloud/region deployments.
*Naming pattern:* {{edp-<capability>-<task>[-<asset>]}}
Examples: {{edp-infra-provision}}, {{edp-ingest-orchestrate-pipelines}}, {{edp-transform-build-warehouse}}, {{edp-model-publish-semantic}}, {{edp-visualize-publish-dashboards}}. (Lowercase, hyphens only.)

# 
# Publish standard and examples in Confluence; notify teams.
# Rename existing repos to the new pattern (no env/region/provider in slug). 
# Update pipelines to use a *matrix* for cloud/region (e.g., {{CLOUD=az|aws}}, {{REGION=au-ae|eu}}).
# Configure Terraform state backends per cloud/region: *azurerm* on Azure, *s3* on AWS.

Please find below the following ADF Pipelines:

* CI - [edp-data-factory-ci - Pipelines|https://dev.azure.com/MyChemist/Enterprise%20Data%20Platform%20Implementation/_apps/hub/ms.vss-build-web.ci-designer-hub?pipelineId=638&branch=master] (Using ci.yaml)

ToDo: 

* changes in the CD process as soon as new environments for SIT and UAT are created.
* further improvements on static security scans during CI (password checks, etc)

Acceptance criteria:

* ADF deployment across different environments are executed using the CD pipeline
* The release pipeline does a comparison with the currently deployed resources and adds/updates existing resources if needed and deletes resources that are not in the deployment package.
* Production changes can still be done manually depending on the rights of the users who have access to the data factory instance. Recommend that this is strictly limited and secured properly.

h3. Steps 

* Create parameterized SQL or Terraform modules for RBAC.
* Define standard roles: Platform Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Analyst etc.
* Automate privilege assignment and auditing.

h3. Deliverables

* -No changes/deployments made manually-","* Working on the RBAC documentation:
** Object Roles Scripts
** Function Roles Scripts
** Assign Object Roles to Function Roles

Added Managed Access Schema strategy to enforce least privilege and enable IaC-driven future grants

*Problem Statement*

Our Snowflake Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) setup, deployed via Azure DevOps, uses a service role ROLE_INFRA_ADMIN_SNOWFLAKE to create and manage objects (databases, schemas, RBAC grants) across environments: *DEV, SIT, UAT, PROD*.

However, there’s a challenge:

* Future grants on schemas and objects require either *MANAGE GRANTS* (a high-privilege, organisation-wide permission) or *schema ownership*.
* Granting *MANAGE GRANTS* to the IaC role violates least-privilege principles.
* We need a *fully automated IaC solution* with no manual steps, while maintaining strong access control.

 

*Proposed Solution: Managed Access Schema + Role Ownership Pattern*

* Use *Managed Access Schemas (MAS)* in all environments for consistent IaC behaviour and centralised grant control.
* *Design Summary*:
** Each schema is created as a Managed Access Schema, e.g.
CREATE SCHEMA EDP_${ENV}.SILVER WITH MANAGED ACCESS;
** Schema ownership is assigned to a dedicated role, e.g.
OPS_${ENV}
** The IaC service role (ROLE_INFRA_ADMIN_SNOWFLAKE) performs grants and object creation on behalf of the schema-owner role (via USE ROLE or delegated ownership).
** Developers in *DEV* can assume the schema-owner role for flexibility.
** In *SIT/UAT/PROD*, only the IaC pipeline holds this privilege — ensuring RBAC consistency, least privilege, and full automation.

 

*Benefits*

|*Area*|*Outcome*|
|*Security*|No need for MANAGE GRANTS; privileges limited to schema level.|
|*Consistency*|Identical IaC templates across all environments.|
|*Governance*|Centralised privilege control via schema-owner roles.|
|*Automation*|All schema creation and grants handled by IaC pipeline, zero manual steps.|
|*Flexibility*|Developers retain freedom in DEV through delegated roles.|

*In short:*
Standardise on Managed Access Schemas across environments and assign schema ownership to environment-specific roles. The IaC role manages objects and future grants under these roles — delivering *full automation*, *least privilege*, and *end-to-end consistency*.

* Snowflake Environment Setup
* ALTIDA Framework
* Snowflake Application (potentially including a dbt component)

We can proceed straightaway with the first three layers to ensure version control of deployment artefacts. The final layer Snowflake Application CI/CD will require more detailed design, as it involves our data model architecture and dbt components.

Implement Azure DNS Private Resolver to enable on-premises DNS resolution for existing Snowflake Private Link endpoint ([privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com|http://privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com]).

The Azure Private Link for Snowflake is already configured and operational. This DNS implementation will enable on-premises systems to resolve the private Snowflake endpoint, which is a prerequisite for subsequent firewall access configuration for Enterprise Data Platform and critical applications requiring Snowflake access.

Spoke to Network team and they suggested we create AD security group for snowflake private link access control and add the relevant users who need access to this group as the user laptop ip address is dynamic so this way we can control this via global protect and firewall.

@user Yes, this is done- VDI network to Snowflake Private Endpoint

Hey @user ,

Given Mike is looking after the jumpbox creation, can this ticket move to done or there is another pending task?

Thanks

Neville would like a dedicated jumpbox for our team instead of using the shared CWR jumpbox (currently used by Sysops, EUCops, Netops, and Secops).

@user , please create a project task to request EUCops to start building the dedicated jumpbox. Neville will guide them through the setup once the task is created.

He also prefers a single firewall request for the new jumpbox once network policies are in place. In the meantime, the team can continue using the existing CWR jumpbox.please make sure not to save huge files with in the jumppbox as it will fill up the back end file server.

Project created under PRJ0116183

Neville to confirm if below user can access existing CWR jumpbox, once confirmed, next steps is to create deliciated jumpbox for EDP

Hi @user / @user ,

I have implemented the review comments provided by @user .

I also need to test the concurrent load testing on the shared pipeline. Looks like to do that we first need to publish the pipeline & triggers into master first so that the triggers can be tested to run parallelly.

Hi @user ,

The PR is merged into Master. We are able to trigger multiple instances of the pipeline for various sources at the same time. I will try to do say 5 concurrent loads at the same time to test how it goes and post the results here today.

FYI

@user @user @user @user

@user Hi Chloe,

Yes currently the PBI user is connecting with the privatelink ([cw-au.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com|http://cw-au.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com]). See below details of the current setup:

We are connecting via the *EDP_ANALYSIS_DEV* warehouse, and using the *S_POWERBI_DEV* user account (basic authentication).

The current VNet Gateway we are connecting with is *cwr-ase-edp-dev-vdgw*:

The virtual network this sits on is *cwr-ase-nonprod-dpdev-vnet*:

And the IP Address under the Subnet for Fabric is *172.29.84.96/27*.

As confirmed by Eugene the IP range below is fixed for Vnet Data Gateway in Dev environment. @user @user @user

We do not need a Snowflake Network Policy when we are using PrivateLink-only.

Once we enable the PrivateLink-only mode via the below scripts:

{noformat}SELECT SYSTEM$ENFORCE_PRIVATELINK_ACCESS_ONLY();{noformat}

Snowflake enforces:

* All traffic must come through Azure PrivateLink
* Public endpoint → fully blocked
* TLS termination happens only on the PrivateLink endpoint
* Source traffic will always appear as your private VNet IPs (10.x.x.x)

This alone gives you a network boundary.

So even without any Snowflake Network Policy: 

* Public access is impossible
* Internet access is impossible
* Malicious external traffic cannot reach your account
* Only PrivateLink-connected Azure VNets can reach Snowflake

@user @user @user @user @user @user

I am looking to enable the Snowflake Privatelink-Only mode however @user tested again this morning and is still having issues with connecting to Snowflake's privatelink via Power BI Desktop. Suggesting delaying enabling privatelink-only mode until we get this resolved. 

Pending updates from Raveen and Eugene on MS response for the above issue.

Enabled the Snowflake Privatelink-Only mode today after confirming SSO authentication from PowerBI to Snowflake successful."

This is for Snowflake to access Manhattan Active. They have already been able to action the whitelisting on their end, but we need to enable whitelisting on our firewall also.
We will be querying their database and ingesting into Snowflake via ADF (same pattern as our network drive). Manhattan won't be accessing anything our end - we just need to enable our firewall so that we can query their DB

h3. More Details:

# Port is 3306 (default) 
# We are wanting to enable the firewall rule for Azure (so our SHIR - which is hosted in Azure can access Manhattan)
# The data flow is: Manhattan Active --> SHIR + ADF --> Blob Storage --> Snowflake
#* We use ADF as the ETL tool to move data from Manhattan to Blob Storage, and the SHIR is the machine which powers this
# The requirement is to have the ability to move data *from Manhattan* *to our Azure* Environment - that's what we need enabled
#* From here, we then use ADF + SHIR to move the data to Snowflake
# SHIR is on an Azure VM Scale Set - cwr-ase-edp-shir-dev-vmss. It is all in the cloud and is sitting in our private network
# Warehouse Management/Stock Data - no PII

Hi @user,

Your understanding is correct. This is to do initial review and start putting initial questions. No build work at the moment. At the moment Amit has provided the mapping sheet for facts ( Fact Sales, electronic payments etc) but not the dimensions yet. Also, he is yet to provide APPRISS data model for us to get started.

Hi @user ,

The historic data ingestion for below 2 tables are done through parquet files. However, There is an ongoing issue with ingestion framework where some of the columns getting missed if they contain null in first row. So, at the moment we have added the missing columns manually. Hence there is a need to test these columns getting populated properly when we manually add these in snowflake tables and views. 

|TDB14|TransactionStorage|TRANSACTIONS_ELECTRONICPAYMENTS|

|TDB14|TransactionStorage|TransactionAuditSaleActivityLogHistory|

@user following up with @user about details for additional tables today.

@user cc @user

Hi @user ,

As discussed yesterday, please provide the list of additional tables required after your review with Bhavya and team.

FYI. @user, @user

Hi @user,

I tested the end to end load for TRANSACTIONS_ELECTRONICPAYMENTS & TransactionAuditSaleActivityLogHistory after the issue of missing column got fixed. 

@user FYI.. There was an ongoing issue where in the historic data load, some of the columns were getting missed in snowflake tables as these columns were empty in the first row. Now the issue is resolved and hence the need for end to end testing.

@user , Hopefully the final remaining list of tables have been finalized for me to get started today.

@user - have these tables been finalised?

Thanks

Hi @user , @user

Amit had indicated that there are some more tables to be ingested while he was doing the mapping documents. However, he is yet to provide the details if any table is missing and needs to be ingested.

Hi @user,

I have received the additional table names from stockDb for ingestion from Amit. However, he advised us to double verify the server details with Bhavya/Adeel.

Hi @user / @user ,

Currently we are ingesting the stock DB data from following server. Amit asked us to verify if this is the right server as he he is not very sure if this is the right one or not. FYI, the below one was identified much earlier (Adeel is aware of). Please double confirm this information.

# *Log Collection:*
#* Network bandwidth logs (e.g., from Network Performance Monitor or Azure Network Watcher) are retained for a minimum of 30 days.
#* ADF pipeline run logs include integration runtime IPs or endpoints for cross-reference.
# *Validation Testing:*
#* At least one high-throughput ADF pipeline is executed to validate that bandwidth spikes are captured and logged as expected.
#* Test scenarios simulate concurrent pipeline runs to verify system responsiveness and alert thresholds.

Chloe to catch up with Raveen to check on status

Logging to Snowflake from a VDI is unsuccessful after the Azure DNS Private Resolver was implemented. Raveen to schedule a call with Eugene, myself and Mike to troubleshoot and discuss next step.

Have reached out to Raveen. Awaiting for resolution updates

Task now unblocked 🙂

Test done successfully with Raveen on login to Snowflake Privatelink via VDI. 

However default roles (provisioned via SCIM) have been wiped out. Raveen to check which settings have caused removal of default roles.

I’ve tested the default role provision via SCIM. All is working well. Happy to close this ticket.

Next steps:

* @user to add a ticket for @user to verify and update subnet in the IaC. 
* @user to let us know about VDI/ Jumpbox access so we can all access Snowflake Privatelink."
CSCI-294,CSCI,CW Cloud Data Platform Interim Solution,Task,Done,Medium,22/Aug/25 7:10 PM,19/Nov/25 1:30 PM,,RITM0173487 - Implement Azure DNS Private Resolver,"Currently worked on by Shagun A.

Implement Azure DNS Private Resolver to enable on-premises DNS resolution for existing Snowflake Private Link endpoint ([privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com|http://privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com]).

The Azure Private Link for Snowflake is already configured and operational. This DNS implementation will enable on-premises systems to resolve the private Snowflake endpoint, which is a prerequisite for subsequent firewall access configuration for Enterprise Data Platform and critical applications requiring Snowflake access.

Spoke to Network team and they suggested we create AD security group for snowflake private link access control and add the relevant users who need access to this group as the user laptop ip address is dynamic so this way we can control this via global protect and firewall. 

 

Current status:","* -Azure DNS Private Resolver is deployed and configured-
* -On-premises DNS resolution is verified-
* -AD Security Group for Snowflake Access is created-
* -Firewall and GlobalProtect integration is validated-
* -Documentation is updated-

currently in progress.

Current status: in fulfilment 
Linked to task RITM0173487

Hi @user - just assigned this to you as I may be able to liaise with you what the status of this ticket is.

Checking on this @user

Hi @user , I tried to reach you to schedule a call on this to explain :)

Could you review attached spreadsheet please

[^RITM0173487_snowflake_connectivity_requirements.xlsx]

 @user, @user

@user what is this for?

Here are two Wiki’s that have dependencies on the privatelink integration:

* [SCIM+SAML - Snowflake and Entra ID SSO Configuration via Azure Private Link - Overview|https://dev.azure.com/MyChemist/Enterprise%20Data%20Platform%20Implementation/_wiki/wikis/Enterprise-Data-Platform-Implementation.wiki/5170/SCIM-SAML-Snowflake-and-Entra-ID-SSO-Configuration-via-Azure-Private-Link]

* [Developer Access - Overview|https://dev.azure.com/MyChemist/Enterprise%20Data%20Platform%20Implementation/_wiki/wikis/Enterprise-Data-Platform-Implementation.wiki/5145/Developer-Access]

Hey@user , are we saying this Jira card is no longer required? or are you talking about the spreadsheet?

we need to collect and consolidate our requests so the team can focus on specifics like VDI, on-prem network requirements, and so forth. Given that not everyone can access the wiki, and it contains quite a lot of information, we should pull together the specific details for them.

@user the private DNS resolver is already in place and configured in Azure ([privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com - Microsoft Azure|https://portal.azure.com/#@mychemist.com.au/resource/subscriptions/154716e9-0cb4-45c8-9fa7-dfea0954bbe1/resourceGroups/cwr-ase-platform-rg/providers/Microsoft.Network/privateDnsZones/privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com/recordsets]), what’s needed is for the DNS forwarding from on-premise DNS servers to the Azure privatelink DNS. See: [Resolve Azure and on-premises domains. | Microsoft Learn|https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-resolver-hybrid-dns]

Thanks@user That’s exactly what I was trying to clarify. Since most of the configurations from RITM0173487 have already been completed. Had a chat with @user, we need to provide detailed information and specifics for the Network team. We can either repurpose the existing card or create a new one to track this outstanding work for Daify

CC @user @user

We have raised CR CHG0052044 for next week to configure Conditional Forwarder

Hi @user Raised Firewall request *RITM0176342* (pre-requisite task for Conditional Forwarding)

Hi @user , @user , @user ,

We are creating Firewall rule in Azure but can you review and confirm sources please? 

# CWR Jumpbox M1
# CWR Jumpbox M2
# M1 RBT Vendor Jumpbox
# M2 RBT Vendor Jumpbox

Just FYI

        ""10.15.0.0/19"",    # Albert Street Head Office
      ]{noformat}

Please note, once we have our own VDI range, we will revisit and update the firewall rule accordingly. 

We should also enforce network policies on snowflake side to block public access.

@user cc @user @user @user

@user @user @user @user , please confirm. 

We can add or exclude VDI Groups later if required

@user / @user @user - do we know if these are the jumpboxes we need?
Just trying to get this over the line so you guys get access.

Hi @user ,

FYI..

@user @user , when we get a separate VDI group for our team, that new group will be part (subset) of this above wider range.

When we receive are VDI group, we will reconfigure the firewall rule to be specific to our group.

hi Raveen, happy to proceed. Thanks! @user

We need to confirm everything is looking as expected.,,"@user - will add task in lieu of this story.

Note:
- Store transactions - local date time. -

 e.g. CWH perth - Local date and time (WST) CWH melb - AEST

The source time zone is intact in the snowflake and there is no impact of the changing the time zone of snowflake account.

Aswini is confirming my findings

Snowflake is not tempering the data in source system. So, the time zone changes of the snowflake accounts are snowflake specific. No impact on import process and unification of time zone should be handled at presentation layer."

I have reviewed the CD pipeline and am satisfied with the following:

* *Branching strategy:* Use a feature branch, merge to {{master}}, then deploy to each environment upon approval.
* *Deployment monitoring:* Check DevOps Releases for deployment status and logs.
* *Script execution:* {{Config_meta.sql}} will be sequenced and run within {{deployment_master_scripts}}.
* *Versioning:* The current mechanism functions but remains limited. We still require a defined process for version naming, review and auto-validation.

*Next step:* Chloe to define the desired version control process with detailed requirements.

The main fact tables to be addressed include:

* {{Fact_Store_Inventory_Intra}}
* {{Fact_Store_Inventory_Adjustment}}
* {{Fact_Store_Inventory_Snapshot}}

These tables are listed as Priority 1 and Priority 2 in the control table and are critical for meeting the acceptance criteria. The goal is to ensure accurate and complete mapping from source to target for these facts.","Priority 1 and Priority 2 Fact tables on control table will be mapped

ETL Logic onPrem. 

Step 1: 

Insert into Staging : 

{noformat}select rn=row_number() over (partition by DateStampDayOnly, MyCHemID, OriginBranchID order by DateStamp desc, RecordID desc)
 ,*
 ,1 as isPlaceholder
 from Fact_Store_IncrementalSOHChanges
 where DateStamp >= ""PreviousDate"" and DateStamp < ""CurrentDate""
 ) dt2
 where rn = 1 {noformat}

Insert into the new data from source which is only housing data changes 

{noformat}insert Into Staging 
select 
 RecordID, MychemID, AvgRealCost, SOH, DateStamp
 , coalesce(ChangeType, 26) as ChangeType -- set null ChangeType to SOH Import
 , coalesce(SOHChange, 0) as SOHChange
 , StaffID, RealCost, ExpectedSales, OriginBranchID, DateStampDayOnly
 , 0 as SOH_Last
 , 0 as ExpectedSales_Last
 , 0 as LineNumber
 , DateStamp as DateStampOriginal
 , 0 as isPlaceholder
 , hasExcessiveValue
from 
 Store_IncrementalSOHChanges
where 
 DateStamp >= ""currentDate"" and 
 DateStamp < ""nextDate"" and
 RecordID > ""maxRecordID"" {noformat}

Then It Self joins and deletes all records where isPlaceholder = 1 and has a record in the second join where the isPlaceholder = 0

{noformat}delete Staging 
from
(
 select nr.OriginBranchID, nr.MyCHemID
 from Staging nr
 where 
 nr.isPlaceholder = 0
 and nr.DateStamp >= @currentDate
 and nr.DateStamp < @nextDate 

) dt
where 
 Staging.isPlaceholder = 1
 and Staging.DateStamp >= ""currentDate""
 and Staging.DateStamp < ""nextDate""
 and Staging.OriginBranchID = dt.OriginBranchID
 and Staging.MychemID = dt.MychemID{noformat}

this ensures that we will have one record for every ChemID , for every Store fore everyday. 

The ETL for this table must be really thought through as it can get quite resource hungry.

Harrison had entered a few more fields. SAFETYSTOCKQTY, DamagedQty,  UnsellableQty and ExpiredQty.

I have done some research to to be able to get these information out of the ERP system. 
expired qty can possibly be found from INVENTBATCH table but when i checked the table it doesn't contain any useful information. 

Have started a conversation with CWR AX Consultants and jess to see if can get this data out.

Hi @user ,

Because below two tables needs historic Ingestion through Parquet and @user is still not able to access blob storage due to network policy changes , the ingestion of these two tables move into next sprint for which we need to create a separate ticket.

|TDB14|TransactionStorage|TRANSACTIONS_ELECTRONICPAYMENTS|

|TDB14|TransactionStorage|TransactionAuditSaleActivityLogHistory|

@user just confirmed wiht @user that we need 8 weeks.
best to create another ticket

@user Confirming, 8 weeks of transactional and audit history in initial data dump, followed by daily delta at T-2.

The main fact tables to be addressed include:

* {{Fact_Store_Inventory_Intra}}
* {{Fact_Store_Inventory_Adjustment}}
* {{Fact_Store_Inventory_Snapshot}}

These tables are listed as Priority 1 and Priority 2 in the control table and are critical for meeting the acceptance criteria. The goal is to ensure accurate and complete mapping from source to target for these facts.","Priority 1 and Priority 2 Fact tables on control table will be mapped

Will take longer time

Fact_Store_Inventory_snapshot and Fact_Store_Inventory_Intra

ETL Logic onPrem. 

Step 1: 

Insert into Staging : 

{noformat}select rn=row_number() over (partition by DateStampDayOnly, MyCHemID, OriginBranchID order by DateStamp desc, RecordID desc)
 ,*
 ,1 as isPlaceholder
 from Fact_Store_IncrementalSOHChanges
 where DateStamp >= ""PreviousDate"" and DateStamp < ""CurrentDate""
 ) dt2
 where rn = 1 {noformat}

Insert into the new data from source which is only housing data changes 

{noformat}insert Into Staging 
select 
 RecordID, MychemID, AvgRealCost, SOH, DateStamp
 , coalesce(ChangeType, 26) as ChangeType -- set null ChangeType to SOH Import
 , coalesce(SOHChange, 0) as SOHChange
 , StaffID, RealCost, ExpectedSales, OriginBranchID, DateStampDayOnly
 , 0 as SOH_Last
 , 0 as ExpectedSales_Last
 , 0 as LineNumber
 , DateStamp as DateStampOriginal
 , 0 as isPlaceholder
 , hasExcessiveValue
from 
 Store_IncrementalSOHChanges
where 
 DateStamp >= ""currentDate"" and 
 DateStamp < ""nextDate"" and
 RecordID > ""maxRecordID"" {noformat}

Then It Self joins and deletes all records where isPlaceholder = 1 and has a record in the second join where the isPlaceholder = 0

{noformat}delete Staging 
from
(
 select nr.OriginBranchID, nr.MyCHemID
 from Staging nr
 where 
 nr.isPlaceholder = 0
 and nr.DateStamp >= @currentDate
 and nr.DateStamp < @nextDate 

) dt
where 
 Staging.isPlaceholder = 1
 and Staging.DateStamp >= ""currentDate""
 and Staging.DateStamp < ""nextDate""
 and Staging.OriginBranchID = dt.OriginBranchID
 and Staging.MychemID = dt.MychemID{noformat}

this ensures that we will have one record for every ChemID , for every Store fore everyday. 

The ETL for this table must be really thought through as it can get quite resource hungry."

Hey @user ,

I ran the testing script and is align with sigma’s KPI report

The only attribute that is not directly pulled is DOI as it would be easier to calculate the 12 week avg in PBI → i.e. SOH$/VPRS$(12 week avg)

Do you wanna give it a good and see that align what you need? Then i will adjust base on that

@user Hi Han!

As discussed this looks great 🙂 I will speak to Harrison about looking to see if we want to include the product level in this view. As well as getting him to enable datasharing of this to our CW SF tenancy.

Will mark this ticket as done 🙂

{quote}Following a review of the on-prem DEV and PROD environments for key databases (StockDB, SCAX2012, ILS, TransactionStorage), discrepancies were identified in schema alignment and data volume. Adeel Syed provided a detailed comparison, highlighting schema mismatches in StockDB and data size differences in TransactionStorage and ILS.

Notably, SCAX2012 was recently refreshed and is up-to-date.

@user has proposed a prioritised refresh plan to align DEV with PROD, particularly to support accurate modelling and pipeline validation in Snowflake environments.

Rachel Wan confirmed that DEV environments are refreshed only upon request and are not automatically synced with PROD.

*Summary of Findings:*

* *SCAX2012*: Recently refreshed (11 July 2025) – no further action required.
* *StockDB*: Schema drift identified across 7 tables (refer to _SchemaCompare.docx_) – refresh required to align DEV with PROD.
* *TransactionStorage*: DEV has more records than PROD due to regular archiving in PROD (not duplication). Tables archived include:
** {{BranchOrderItems}}, {{BranchOrders}}, {{Store_IncrementalSOHChanges}}, {{Transactions}}, {{Transactions_Invoice}}
** {{Shipment_detail}}, {{Shipment_header}}
* *ILS*: Data size gaps observed – refresh recommended but not urgent.

*Proposed Refresh Priority:*

# *StockDB* – to resolve schema mismatches.
# *TransactionStorage* – to align data volume and ensure DEV reflects current PROD state.
# *ILS* – to be scheduled after the above.{quote}","*StockDB refresh*

* How to authenticate
* How users will need to be granted access
* At what level (in SF) do we grant permissions for access (do we do this at a DB level or tenancy level? etc)","* -To test and cover all requirements.-
* -Have all requirements documented (in Confluence/Sharepoint).-","Currently unable to connect via the Privatelink URL (cw-au.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com) via PBI desktop - have asked Eugene to look into this

h2. How to Authenticate

Developers will start in PBI Desktop/Tabular Editor. To begin development, the user will select the Snowflake connector type and enter in their credentials:

* Server: cw-au.privatelink.snowflakecomputing.com
* Warehouse: <spoke’s dedicated PBI warehouse>
* Login details: SSO with AAD

From here a developer can select the table/s they wish to pull from Snowflake. As they’ve signed in as themselves they will view all tables that they have access to in Snowflake.

Once selected, the developer will choose ‘import mode’ for their data (we will discourage the use of DirectQuery).

From here they will develop and build their dashboard. Once completed they will publish to their Workspace in PBI Service.

Once published, the user will go to their semantic model settings. They will need to navigate to ‘Gateway and cloud connections’, select +On+ for ‘Use an On-premises or VNet data gateway’. Locate to the VNet gateway and map the Snowflake data source to their relevant connection name (their connection will be to a Service Account, based on the spoke’s dedicated warehouse and roles granted). After selected, hit ‘apply’ and the semantic model is ready to be deployed and refreshed.

h2. What developers need access to

h3. Snowflake

* Snowflake login (setup with AAD SSO)
* Their spoke’s environment in SF
** Configured at the role level
*** Each role will have a dedicated warehouse to be used for PBI reports and refreshes
*** The roles grant access to the relevant DB’s/schema’s/table’s in SF
*** Each role will have a warehouse where users can query SF for analytics and sourcing data

h3. Power BI

* Power BI Desktop
* Tabular Editor Pro (if applicable for super users)
* PBI VNet Gateway connection created (for each spoke) at a service account level
** Access distinguished by the role and warehouse for that spoke
* PBI VNet Gateway connection shared (user permissions)
** This should be configured at an AD Group level

Eugene clarified that there are 2 things that are pending that need to happen to resolve this:

* DNS resolution
* Network team to build firewall settings

Once completed, users will be able to query SF’s privatelink even in PBI Desktop

Hi Eugene 🙂 

FYI been testing connecting PBI to Snowflake today, so far so good with everything regarding the VNet gateway you configured 🙂 Thanks for all your help.

One thing I noticed is within PBI Desktop, I can’t seem to connect to our Snowflake server with the privatelink URL (cw-au.*privatelink*.snowflakecomputing.com). I have no issues in PBI Service.

Are you able to enable the use of the privatelink in the PBI Desktop app? Would we need to be able to do the same in tabular editor also?

Let me know, thanks! 🙂

@user are you connecting directly from PowerBI? Or are you using a Semantic Model from PowerBI?

@user connecting directly from PBI desktop.

As discussed on our call just now, this question is now resolved 🙂 we are awaiting for the DNS resolution to be completed, plus for firewalls to be configured with the network team before this is able to be done."

@user thanks Eugene! this looks great 🙂 

For the Azure VM’s as a backup - can you clarify in what kind of scenarios this would be required? How would this differ to using jumpbox?

Also for the non-CW domain users (eg: Harrison and Phillip) - in this architecture can they access CW data? Do they have access to using jumpbox etc? Maybe something else to consider 🙂 

Cheers

@user the Azure VM is going to be used as a fallback when all the other options are not accessible, e.g. ExpressRoute is down, VPN Access not available, Jumpboxes not available.

For non-CW domain users, they may need CW accounts if there is not account federation yet.

Plan to be put in place as part of review

I’ve reviewed Adeel analysis on the current retention policy. To revisit this with ticket CSCI 221"
CSCI-185,CSCI,CW Cloud Data Platform Interim Solution,Task,Done,Medium,25/Jul/25 10:10 AM,04/Aug/25 6:03 AM,,Adeel - On-prem DEV/PROD Database Environment Sync,"Following a review of the on-prem DEV and PROD environments for key databases (StockDB, SCAX2012, ILS, TransactionStorage), discrepancies were identified in schema alignment and data volume. Adeel Syed provided a detailed comparison, highlighting schema mismatches in StockDB and data size differences in TransactionStorage and ILS. 

Notably, SCAX2012 was recently refreshed and is up-to-date.

@user has proposed a prioritised refresh plan to align DEV with PROD, particularly to support accurate modelling and pipeline validation in Snowflake environments. 

Rachel Wan confirmed that DEV environments are refreshed only upon request and are not automatically synced with PROD.

*Summary of Findings:*

* *SCAX2012*: Recently refreshed (11 July 2025) – no further action required.
* *StockDB*: Schema drift identified across 7 tables (refer to _SchemaCompare.docx_) – refresh required to align DEV with PROD.
* *TransactionStorage*: DEV has more records than PROD due to regular archiving in PROD (not duplication). Tables archived include:
** {{BranchOrderItems}}, {{BranchOrders}}, {{Store_IncrementalSOHChanges}}, {{Transactions}}, {{Transactions_Invoice}}
** {{Shipment_detail}}, {{Shipment_header}}
* *ILS*: Data size gaps observed – refresh recommended but not urgent.

*Proposed Refresh Priority:*

# *StockDB* – to resolve schema mismatches.
# *TransactionStorage* – to align data volume and ensure DEV reflects current PROD state.
# *ILS* – to be scheduled after the above.

@Rachel Wan – to advise on the formal process for requesting refreshes for these databases. 
Once confirmed, requests to be raised.","*StockDB Refresh*

* Schema drift issues resolved.
* -DEV schema matches PROD schema as per {{SchemaCompare.docx}}.-

*TransactionStorage Refresh*

* -Data volume aligned between DEV and PROD.-
* -DEV duplicates addressed.-
* -Tables listed by Adeel (e.g., {{BranchOrderItems}}, {{Transactions}}, {{Shipment_detail}}) archived appropriately in PROD.-

*ILS Refresh*

* -Data volume aligned between DEV and PROD.-
* -Refresh scheduled post StockDB and TransactionStorage updates.-

*Confirmation*

* -Rachel Wan to advise on the formal process for initiating refresh requests.-
* -Refresh timelines and responsible parties confirmed.-","@user descriptions udpate FYI

Adeel drive DEV refresh requests and discussions

Phil to drive activity, assistance required for Adeel.

@user

I have caught up with @user 

{quote}* got to go ahead for ILS DB refresh
* currently needing to work out on the refresh plan as it will be performed for the first time
* schema drift in Stockdb exists due to the dev work going on with other project.
** if this stockdb is refreshed, then we need to replicate those schema drifts in dev env again
*** discussion with Chloe @userhappened this afternoon - stockdb refresh is not needed as for now.

Adeel carry over from this ticket to be transitioned to Sprint 5 @user plus assign to Adeel when done

StockDB to not be refreshed, as DEV Schema is per new build. Validate Go Live of new changes to ensure we dont go in earlier.

SCAX2012 =- refreshed recently

TransactioStorage - refreshing being worked through

ils - refreshing being worked through

@user

approvals gained for ILS refresh. @user

Expected to finish today
NOted:
- refresh risk for scale - 

@user discuss about the above

to split out task:

* Issues with ETL_Update stamping
** ETL_UPDATE in the Fact is altered even if the Fact metrics, attributes or Dim Key relationships are unchanged. An attribute of a Dim that the object connects to has changed but the Key values havent, yet the ETL_Update stamp is altered. means there are significanlty more changes in historical data in Fact then should be, this impacts ability to perform incremental refreshes etc
* MERGE issue

expired qty can possibly be found from INVENTBATCH table but when i checked the table it doesn't contain any useful information.

However upon further inspection, this modified time appears to only be when a table was last altered structurally, eg: creating a new column, or performing a DROP and CREATE statement etc

Was able to locate a different system table: *sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats*.

This table stores index usage stats. We can use the last modified date from this table to form as an approximation to when a table was last modified (if any data was inserted or deleted from a table, this is included within the modified date logic).

Currently need to request additional access from DB team to query this table (require VIEW SERVER STATE permissions). Have spoken to Rachel Wan and she is ok with approving this permission (at least for PBI05 initially). Awaiting access.

AE: (from attached email)

Direct from our Gateway (IP: 192.168.42.65 or 88 – both PowerBI gateway servers)

To MySQL server (172.19.232.11)

Through IP whitelisting/firewall rules

Standard TCP connection on port 3306

 

 

# Best way to connect mainly from data extraction purposes

AE: Above, Analitics team use a MYSQL connector . not sure how they use it. Rachel Foong should be able to provide more info

 

# Is it the live data source or a copy

AE: Copy

 

# If so , refresh frequency

AE: (from attached email)

“We worked with the CloudOps team and confirmed that there is no lag or issue with the Data Save replica database.”

 

# Any Schema Documentation

We don’t have this, maybe check with  Rachel Foong

(see “MAWM – Questions” mail)

 

# Any mapping document between old Scale and New MAWM Data

We don’t have this, maybe check with  Rachel Foong

Next steps: 
what is the best way to connect for ingestion purpose. I think we can explore Azure/Snowflake options and reconnect later. 

Schema Documentation: We should touch base with MAWM team . Point of action for later

Mapping Document: We should touch base with MAWM team . Point of action for later

@user @user Any thoughts?

Hey @user ,

Not sure what additional details you have added that weren't known 2 weeks ago from Teams and Stand-Up discussions.

You have said ask another person a lot throughout this response also. Can I confirm you are going to own DFIO portion for future analysis to understand where the data currently lives? Where will it live in future? Details etc? CK can help I would say.

For Manhattan Active, we have got those details from CK a few weeks ago. We need to know how many DC’s on it and the roll out plan, core objects to pull etc. If not same as Manhattan Scale.

Thanks,

Harrison

*Jess C to Action:* PBI03 was also a source mentioned in some lineage, can we trace lineage for these back to actual source (PDB19B, PDB08, SQL3 etc). CK email may answer this last part.

*Eugene:* There were some PBI objects that could not be traced back (difficulty in tracing logic therefore decision is made) to actual source therefore decision was made in EDP project to use the PBI object rather then the source db. *Amit and Bhavya should have this background as well*.

CSCI-95,CSCI,CW Cloud Data Platform Interim Solution,Task,Done,Medium,20/Jun/25 9:43 AM,07/Jul/25 9:48 AM,,Create a Data Ingestion plan,"* To identify the first 3 sources (databases) to be ingested first to EDP Snowflake
* Definition of Done:
** Outline the database names, tables name
** Get approval from relevant stakeholders (CK, Harrison, Rachel etc.) to ingest to Snowflake",,"I’ve been working with Eugene to better understand the data ingestion challenges encountered during EDP 1.0. Based on those insights, we plan to implement *two pipelines per data source*, particularly for those with high data volumes:

# *Initial Load Pipeline*
This pipeline will handle a one-time bulk load. The DBA team will extract data from the on-premises databases and upload it to Azure Blob Storage as *CSV or Parquet* files. We understand that using Parquet format can help mitigate data quality issues. Once the files are available in Blob Storage, we’ll trigger the pipeline to ingest the data into Snowflake.
# *Incremental Load Pipeline*
This pipeline will manage ongoing data updates by loading incremental changes *directly* from the source databases.

To support this approach, I’ll be setting up an ADF template specifically for extracting data from Parquet files during the initial load phase.

So I believe we need the assistance from Rachel's / DBA team at least in the below:

* Help us validate our current data source mapping is accurate and complete.
* Extract data from the confirmed databases and upload the data to Azure Blob Storage in *Parquet* format.

Some challenges:

It’s noted that there were a lot of similar fact tables generated with the same metric values but at a +_different aggregate_+.

Hi @user,

Your points below align to the convo @user and I had yesterday.

Agree that this task needs to be completed after we have reviewed the business processes/facts first (task [https://sigmahealthcare.atlassian.net/browse/CSCI-94|https://sigmahealthcare.atlassian.net/browse/CSCI-94]). The dimension review has already been completed ([https://sigmahealthcare.atlassian.net/browse/CSCI-81|https://sigmahealthcare.atlassian.net/browse/CSCI-81]).

Chloe and I spoke that after the fact review has been complete that I will then go into our Bus Matrix document and update/add any dims and facts that are not currently included.

The data source mapping work I think will need to be its own separate task initially. From what I can see from the current Supply Chain Semantic Models, there are a lot of hops their data source goes through to go from source system to report. Majority of their connections in PBI service are to the *PBI05* server.

Example of some of the lineage:

PBI05 (BI Server) ← PDB08 (AX 2012 Server) ← Azure Blob Storage (for a CSV file load)

Chloe and I are going to look into this further next week to understand what transformations are done between each hop/source 🙂 

I have details of the source connection info that supply chain team are using in PBI service, so once we unpack the lineage from the actual source system, we can join the dots to complete this task."

Currently the Supply Chain team are working to re-map all their existing semantic models to reference only from these above 12 ‘master semantic models' to become as their new source.

There are currently *42 semantic models* in the Operations Analytics workspace in total (excluding their sandbox workspace). These 42 include the above 12, meaning there are currently *30 semantic models* that are created that do not form as part of this ‘master layer’.

The team are in the work-in-progress stage of this migration/re-mapping of their semantic models. For example currently the ‘S&OP Projections’ semantic model only has inputs coming from the ‘master layer’, whereas the ‘SPS KPIs’ semantic model currently has inputs only coming from a DB source (nothing from the master layer).

 

The advice would be:

* Continue to re-map all their current semantic models to this master layer, to reduce the number of queries against the database servers
* Work with the SC team to establish if we can group these models further (eg: can we group ‘DC Inbound Shipments’, ‘DC Outbound Shipments’ and ‘DC Shipment Wave’ as 1 single ‘DC Shipments’ model?)

Currently the Supply Chain team are working to re-map all their existing semantic models to reference only from these above 12 ‘master semantic models' to become as their new source. 

There are currently *42 semantic models* in the Operations Analytics workspace in total (excluding their sandbox workspace). These 42 include the above 12, meaning there are currently *30 semantic models* that are created that do not form as part of this ‘master layer’.

The team are in the work-in-progress stage of this migration/re-mapping of their semantic models. For example currently the ‘S&OP Projections’ semantic model only has inputs coming from the ‘master layer’, whereas the ‘SPS KPIs’ semantic model currently has inputs only coming from a DB source (nothing from the master layer).

The advice would be:

* Continue to re-map all their current semantic models to this master layer, to reduce the number of queries against the database servers
* Work with the SC team to establish if we can group these models further (eg: can we group ‘DC Inbound Shipments’, ‘DC Outbound Shipments’ and ‘DC Shipment Wave’ as 1 single ‘DC Shipments’ model?)

h3. Measures

Currently across the 42 semantic models, we have *692 unique/individual measures*. Some of these can be referencing the same value but expressing this as a different output (eg: *sales* in absolute $'s, *sales* as a %, *sales* last 60 days, etc).

Attached is a list of all measures as of 16.6.25.
